action_pool_depth
    Current value (from the default) = -1
      From //build/toolchain/BUILD.gn:10

    Pool for non goma tasks.

also_build_ash_chrome
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromeos/ui_mode.gni:23

    Setting this to true when building LaCrOS-chrome will cause it to
    *also* build ash-chrome in a subdirectory using an alternate toolchain.
    Don't set this unless you're sure you want it, because it'll double
    your build time.

android_full_debug
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:51

    Normally, Android builds are lightly optimized, even for debug builds, to
    keep binary size down. Setting this flag to true disables such optimization

    Overridden from the default = true
      From //third_party/angle/BUILD.gn:35

    Don't build extra (test, samples etc) for Windows UWP. We don't have
    infrastructure (e.g. windowing helper functions) in place to run them.

angle_delegate_workers
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/angle/gni/angle.gni:102

    By default, ANGLE is using a thread pool for parallel compilation.
    Activating the delegate worker results in posting the tasks using the
    embedder API. In Chromium code base, it results in sending tasks to the
    worker thread pool.

angle_enable_abseil
    Current value = false
      From //.gn:27
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //third_party/angle/BUILD.gn:42

cast_is_debug
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:16

    If true, IS_CAST_DEBUG_BUILD() will evaluate to 1 in version.h. Otherwise,
    it will evaluate to 0. Overriding this when is_debug=false is useful for
    doing engineering builds.

cc_wrapper
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/toolchain/cc_wrapper.gni:36

    Set to "ccache", "icecc" or "distcc".  Probably doesn't work on windows.

    empty.

chromeos_is_browser_only
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromeos/ui_mode.gni:17

    Deprecated, use is_lacros.
   
    This controls UI configuration for Chrome.
    If this flag is set, we assume Chrome runs on Chrome OS devices, using
    Wayland (instead of X11).
   
    TODO(crbug.com/1052397):
    Define chromeos_product instead, which takes either "browser" or "ash".

      From //out/Release/args.gn:4
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:108

    Turn this on to have the compiler output extra timing information.

compute_build_timestamp
    Current value (from the default) = "compute_build_timestamp.py"
      From //build/timestamp.gni:17

    This should be the filename of a script that prints a single line
    containing an integer that's a unix timestamp in UTC.
    This timestamp is used as build time and will be compiled into
    other code.
   
    This argument may look unused. Before removing please check with the
    chromecast team to see if they still use it internally.

concurrent_links
    Current value (from the default) = -1
      From //build/toolchain/concurrent_links.gni:22

    Limit the number of concurrent links; we often want to run fewer
    links at once than we do compiles, because linking is memory-intensive.
    The default to use varies by platform and by the amount of memory
    available, so we call out to a script to get the right value.

coverage_instrumentation_input_file
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/coverage/coverage.gni:29

    The path to the coverage instrumentation input file should be a source root
    absolute path (e.g. //out/Release/coverage_instrumentation_input.txt), and
    the file consists of multiple lines where each line represents a path to a
    source file, and the paths must be relative to the root build directory.
    e.g. ../../base/task/post_task.cc for build directory 'out/Release'.
   
    NOTE that this arg will be non-op if use_clang_coverage is false.

cros_board
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/chromeos/args.gni:8

    Enable Dawn's ASSERTs even in release builds

dawn_complete_static_libs
    Current value = true
      From //out/Release/args.gn:5
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //scripts/dawn_features.gni:48

    Should the Dawn static libraries be fully linked vs. GN's default of
    treating them as source sets. This is useful for people using Dawn
    standalone to produce static libraries to use in their projects.

dawn_enable_cross_reflection
    Current value = true
      From //out/Release/args.gn:6
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //scripts/dawn_features.gni:73

    Enable use of reflection compiler in spirv-cross. This is needed
    if performing reflection on systems that the platform language
    shader is SPIR-V, since there isn't an instance of the
    GLSL/HLSL/MSL compiler. This implicitly pulls in the GLSL
    compiler, since it is a sub-class of it.

dawn_enable_d3d12
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //scripts/dawn_features.gni:51

    Enables the compilation of Dawn's D3D12 backend

dawn_enable_opengl
    Current value = true
      From //out/Release/args.gn:7
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //scripts/dawn_features.gni:62

    Enables the compilation of Dawn's OpenGL backend
    (best effort, non-conformant)

dawn_enable_vulkan
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //scripts/dawn_features.gni:65

    Enables the compilation of Dawn's Vulkan backend

dawn_enable_vulkan_loader
    Current value = true
      From //out/Release/args.gn:8
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //scripts/dawn_features.gni:94

      From //scripts/dawn_features.gni:30

dawn_use_swiftshader
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //scripts/dawn_features.gni:38

    Enables usage of swiftshader on the Vulkan backend.
    Note that this will only work in standalone and in projects that set the
    dawn_swiftshader_dir variable in build_overrides/dawn.gni
    Because of how the Vulkan loader works, setting this makes Dawn only able
    to find the Swiftshader ICD and not the others.
    Enabled by default when fuzzing.

dawn_use_x11
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //scripts/dawn_features.gni:25

    Whether Dawn should enable X11 support.

dcheck_always_on
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/dcheck_always_on.gni:14

    Set to true to enable dcheck in Release builds.

dcheck_is_configurable
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/dcheck_always_on.gni:9

    Enables DCHECKs to be built-in, but to default to being non-fatal/log-only.
    DCHECKS can then be set as fatal/non-fatal via the DCheckIsFatal feature.
    See crbug.com/596231 for details on how this is used.

disable_libfuzzer
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:97

    Helper variable for testing builds with disabled libfuzzer.
    Not for client use.

    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:158

    Turn off the --call-graph-profile-sort flag for lld by default. Enable
    selectively for targets where it's beneficial.

enable_cast_renderer
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:49

    True to enable the cast renderer.  It is enabled by default for linux and
    android audio only builds.

enable_cet_shadow_stack
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:109

    Experimental option to mark binaries as compatible with Shadow
    Stack of Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET). If Windows version
    and hardware supports the feature and it's enabled by OS then additional
    additional validation of return address will be performed as mitigation
    against Return-oriented programming (ROP).

enable_dsyms
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/mac/symbols.gni:17

    Produce dSYM files for targets that are configured to do so. dSYM
    generation is controlled globally as it is a linker output (produced via
    the //build/toolchain/mac/linker_driver.py. Enabling this will result in
    all shared library, loadable module, and executable targets having a dSYM
    generated.

enable_full_stack_frames_for_profiling
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:58

    Compile in such a way as to make it possible for the profiler to unwind full
    stack frames. Setting this flag has a large effect on the performance of the
    generated code than just setting profiling, but gives the profiler more
    information to analyze.
    Requires profiling to be set to true.

enable_iterator_debugging
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/c++/c++.gni:42

    When set, enables libc++ debug mode with iterator debugging.
   
    Iterator debugging is generally useful for catching bugs. But it can
    introduce extra locking to check the state of an iterator against the state
    of the current object. For iterator- and thread-heavy code, this can
    significantly slow execution - two orders of magnitude slowdown has been
    seen (crbug.com/903553) and iterator debugging also slows builds by making
    generation of snapshot_blob.bin take ~40-60 s longer. Therefore this
    defaults to off.

enable_modular_updater
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:30

    Set true to enable modular_updater.

enable_precompiled_headers
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/pch.gni:11

    Precompiled header file support is by default available,
    but for distributed build system uses (like goma) or when
    doing official builds.

enable_profiling
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:51

    Compile in such a way as to enable profiling of the generated code. For
    example, don't omit the frame pointer and leave in symbols.

enable_segment_heap
    Current value = true
      From //out/Release/args.gn:10
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //build/config/win/manifest.gni:46

enable_stripping
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/mac/symbols.gni:24

    Strip symbols from linked targets by default. If this is enabled, the
    //build/config/mac:strip_all config will be applied to all linked targets.
    If custom stripping parameters are required, remove that config from a
    linked target and apply custom -Wcrl,strip flags. See
    //build/toolchain/mac/linker_driver.py for more information.

enable_wmax_tokens
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:149

exclude_unwind_tables
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:97

    Exclude unwind tables by default for official builds as unwinding can be
    done from stack dumps produced by Crashpad at a later time "offline" in the
    crash server. Since this increases binary size, we don't recommend including
    them in shipping builds.
    For unofficial (e.g. development) builds and non-Chrome branded (e.g. Cronet
    which doesn't use Crashpad, crbug.com/479283) builds it's useful to be able
    to unwind at runtime.

fatal_linker_warnings
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:68

    Enable fatal linker warnings. Building Chromium with certain versions
    of binutils can cause linker warning.
    TODO(thakis): Set this to true unconditionally once lld/MachO bring-up
    is along far enough that it no longer emits linker warnings.

forbid_non_component_debug_builds
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:88

    Whether an error should be raised on attempts to make debug builds with
    is_component_build=false. Very large debug symbols can have unwanted side
    effects so this is enforced by default for chromium.

generate_linker_map
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/toolchain.gni:26

    Used for binary size analysis.

gold_path
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:62

    When we are going to use gold we need to find it.
    This is initialized below, after use_gold might have been overridden.

goma_dir
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/toolchain/goma.gni:17

    Absolute directory containing the gomacc binary.

host_byteorder
    Current value (from the default) = "undefined"
      From //build/config/host_byteorder.gni:9

host_cpu
    Current value (from the default) = "x64"
      (Internally set; try `gn help host_cpu`.)

host_os
    Current value (from the default) = "win"
      (Internally set; try `gn help host_os`.)

host_pkg_config
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/linux/pkg_config.gni:36

    A optional pkg-config wrapper to use for tools built on the host.

host_toolchain
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:145

    This should not normally be set as a build argument.  It's here so that
    every toolchain can pass through the "global" value via toolchain_args().

ignore_elf32_limitations
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build_overrides/build.gni:25

    Android 32-bit non-component, non-clang builds cannot have symbol_level=2
    due to 4GiB file size limit, see https://crbug.com/648948.

init_stack_vars
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:135

    Initialize all local variables with a pattern. This flag will fill
    uninitialized floating-point types (and 32-bit pointers) with 0xFF and the
    rest with 0xAA. This makes behavior of uninitialized memory bugs consistent,
    recognizable in the debugger, and crashes on memory accesses through
    uninitialized pointers.
   
    TODO(crbug.com/1131993): Enabling this when 'is_android' is true breaks
    content_shell_test_apk on both ARM and x86.
   
    TODO(crbug.com/977230): Enabling this when 'use_xcode_clang' is true may
    call an old clang that doesn't support auto-init.

ios_deployment_target
    Current value (from the default) = "12.2"
      From //build/config/ios/ios_sdk_overrides.gni:10

    Version of iOS that we're targeting.

ios_use_goma_rbe
    Current value (from the default) = -1
      From //build/toolchain/goma.gni:31

    Deprecated and ignored as Goma RBE is now the default. Still exists
    to avoid breaking the build on the bots. Will be removed when all
    bots have been configured to not set this variable.

is_asan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:14

    Compile for Address Sanitizer to find memory bugs.

is_cast_audio_only
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:23

    Set this true for an audio-only Chromecast build.

is_cast_desktop_build
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:42

    True if Chromecast build is targeted for linux desktop. This type of build
    is useful for testing and development, but currently supports only a subset
    of Cast functionality. Though this defaults to true for x86 Linux devices,
    this should be overriden manually for an embedded x86 build.
    TODO(slan): Remove instances of this when x86 is a fully supported platform.

is_cfi
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:62

is_chrome_branded
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chrome_build.gni:9

    Select the desired branding flavor. False means normal Chromium branding,
    true means official Google Chrome branding (requires extra Google-internal
    resources).

is_chromecast
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:11

    Set this true for a Chromecast build. Chromecast builds are supported on
    Linux and Android.

is_chromeos_device
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/chromeos/args.gni:26

    Determines if we're building for a Chrome OS device (or VM) and not just
    linux-chromeos. NOTE: Most test targets in Chrome expect to run under
    linux-chromeos, so some have compile-time asserts that intentionally fail
    when this build flag is set. Build and run the tests for linux-chromeos
    instead.
    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/chromeos_build_instructions.md
    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/simple_chrome_workflow.md

is_clang
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:134

    Set to true when compiling with the Clang compiler.

is_component_build
    Current value = true
      From //out/Release/args.gn:11
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:162

    Component build. Setting to true compiles targets declared as "components"
    as shared libraries loaded dynamically. This speeds up development time.
    When false, components will be linked statically.
   
    For more information see
    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/component_build.md

is_debug
    Current value = false
      From //out/Release/args.gn:12
    Overridden from the default = true
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:152

    Debug build. Enabling official builds automatically sets is_debug to false.

is_ggp
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/angle/gni/angle.gni:8

is_hwasan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:19

    Compile for Hardware-Assisted Address Sanitizer to find memory bugs
    (android/arm64 only).
    See http://clang.llvm.org/docs/HardwareAssistedAddressSanitizerDesign.html

is_lsan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:22

    Compile for Leak Sanitizer to find leaks.

is_msan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:25

    Compile for Memory Sanitizer to find uninitialized reads.

is_official_build
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:131

    Set to enable the official build level of optimization. This has nothing
    to do with branding, but enables an additional level of optimization above
    release (!is_debug). This might be better expressed as a tri-state
    (debug, release, official) but for historical reasons there are two
    separate flags.

is_tsan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:28

    Compile for Thread Sanitizer to find threading bugs.

is_ubsan
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:32

    Compile for Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer to find various types of
    undefined behaviour (excludes vptr checks).

is_ubsan_no_recover
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:35

    Halt the program if a problem is detected.

is_ubsan_null
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:38

    Compile for Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer's null pointer checks.

is_ubsan_security
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:93

    Enables core ubsan security features. Will later be removed once it matches
    is_ubsan.

is_ubsan_vptr
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:41

    Compile for Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer's vptr checks.

is_win_arm64
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/angle/gni/angle.gni:94

    Currently Windows on Arm doesn't support OpenGL or Vulkan.

libcxx_abi_unstable
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/c++/BUILD.gn:19

    lldb pretty printing only works when libc++ is built in the __1 (or __ndk1)
    namespaces.  For pretty printing to work out-of-the-box on Mac (where lldb
    is primarily used), this flag is set to false to build with the __1
    namespace (to maintain ABI compatibility, this implies building without
    _LIBCPP_ABI_UNSTABLE).  This is not necessary on non-component builds
    because we leave the ABI version set to __1 in that case because libc++
    symbols are not exported.
    TODO(thomasanderson): Set this to true by default once rL352899 is available
    in MacOS's lldb.

libcxx_is_shared
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/c++/c++.gni:56

    WARNING: Setting this to a non-default value is highly discouraged.
    If true, libc++ will be built as a shared library; otherwise libc++ will be
    linked statically. Setting this to something other than the default is
    unsupported and can be broken by libc++ rolls. Note that if this is set to
    true, you must also set libcxx_abi_unstable=false, which is bad for
    performance and memory use.

libcxx_natvis_include
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/c++/c++.gni:31

    Builds libcxx Natvis into the symbols for type visualization.
    Set to false to workaround http://crbug.com/966676 and
    http://crbug.com/966687.

libcxx_svn_revision
    Current value (from the default) = "375504"
      From //buildtools/deps_revisions.gni:8

    The libc++ svn revision that belongs to the git hash in DEPS. Used to cause
    full rebuilds on libc++ rolls.

llvm_force_head_revision
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/toolchain.gni:18

    If this is set to true, or if LLVM_FORCE_HEAD_REVISION is set to 1
    in the environment, we use the revision in the llvm repo to determine
    the CLANG_REVISION to use, instead of the version hard-coded into
    //tools/clang/scripts/update.py. This should only be used in
    conjunction with setting LLVM_FORCE_HEAD_REVISION in the
    environment when `gclient runhooks` is run as well.

mac_sdk_min
    Current value (from the default) = "10.15"
      From //build/config/mac/mac_sdk_overrides.gni:12

mips_use_mmi
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/mips.gni:13

    MIPS MultiMedia Instruction compilation flag.

msan_track_origins
    Current value (from the default) = 2
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:46

    Track where uninitialized memory originates from. From fastest to slowest:
    0 - no tracking, 1 - track only the initial allocation site, 2 - track the
    chain of stores leading from allocation site to use site.

ndk_api_level_at_least_26
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/angle/gni/angle.gni:73

needs_gomacc_path_arg
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/goma.gni:14

    This flag is for ChromeOS compiler wrapper.
    By passing gomacc path via cmd-line arg, ChromeOS' compiler wrapper
    invokes gomacc inside it.

optimize_for_fuzzing
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:101

    Optimize for coverage guided fuzzing (balance between speed and number of
    branches). Can be also used to remove non-determinism and other issues.

ozone_auto_platforms
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/ozone.gni:16

    Select platforms automatically. Turn this off for manual control.

ozone_extra_path
    Current value (from the default) = "//build/config/ozone_extra.gni"
      From //build/config/ozone.gni:13

    Ozone extra platforms file path. Can be overridden to build out of
    tree ozone platforms.

ozone_platform
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/ozone.gni:26

    The platform that will used at runtime by default. This can be overridden
    with the command line flag --ozone-platform=<platform>.

ozone_platform_cast
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/ozone.gni:29

    Compile the 'cast' platform.

ozone_platform_drm
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/ozone.gni:32

    Compile the 'drm' platform.

ozone_platform_gbm
    Current value (from the default) = -1
      From //build/config/ozone.gni:20

    TODO(petermcneeley): Backwards compatiblity support for VM images.
    Remove when deprecated. (https://crbug.com/1122009)

ozone_platform_headless
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/ozone.gni:35

    Compile the 'headless' platform.

ozone_platform_scenic
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/ozone.gni:38

    Compile the 'scenic' platform.

ozone_platform_wayland
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/ozone.gni:44

    Compile the 'wayland' platform.

ozone_platform_windows
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/ozone.gni:47

    Compile the 'windows' platform.

ozone_platform_x11
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/ozone.gni:41

    Compile the 'x11' platform.

pgo_data_path
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/compiler/pgo/pgo.gni:24

    When using chrome_pgo_phase = 2, read profile data from this path.

pkg_config
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/linux/pkg_config.gni:33

    A pkg-config wrapper to call instead of trying to find and call the right
    pkg-config directly. Wrappers like this are common in cross-compilation
    environments.
    Leaving it blank defaults to searching PATH for 'pkg-config' and relying on
    the sysroot mechanism to find the right .pc files.

proprietary_codecs
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/features.gni:26

    Enables proprietary codecs and demuxers; e.g. H264, AAC, MP3, and MP4.
    We always build Google Chrome and Chromecast with proprietary codecs.
   
    Note: this flag is used by WebRTC which is DEPSed into Chrome. Moving it
    out of //build will require using the build_overrides directory.

rts_exclude_file
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/BUILDCONFIG.gn:173

    Regression Test Selection (RTS).
    https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/testing/regression-test-selection.md
   
    Exclude unittest/browsertest files listed in this file.
   
    Entries should be newline separated.
    Each entry much be an source-absolute path starting with //.

sample_profile_is_accurate
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:125

    Whether we should consider the profile we're using to be accurate. Accurate
    profiles have the benefit of (potentially substantial) binary size
    reductions, by instructing the compiler to optimize cold and uncovered
    functions heavily for size. This often comes at the cost of performance.

sanitizer_coverage_flags
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:111

    Value for -fsanitize-coverage flag. Setting this causes
    use_sanitizer_coverage to be enabled.
    This flag is not used for libFuzzer (use_libfuzzer=true). Instead, we use:
        -fsanitize=fuzzer-no-link
    Default value when unset and use_fuzzing_engine=true:
        trace-pc-guard
    Default value when unset and use_sanitizer_coverage=true:
        trace-pc-guard,indirect-calls

strip_debug_info
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:47

    Android-only: Strip the debug info of libraries within lib.unstripped to
    reduce size. As long as symbol_level > 0, this will still allow stacks to be
    symbolized.

supports_llvm
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/swiftshader/src/Reactor/BUILD.gn:22

swiftshader_optimized_debug_build
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/swiftshader/src/swiftshader.gni:23

    By default, build SwiftShader with optimizations enabled in debug
    for performance reasons. Set to false to build as unoptimized.

symbol_level
    Current value = 2
      From //out/Release/args.gn:13
    Overridden from the default = -1
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:42

    How many symbols to include in the build. This affects the performance of
    the build since the symbols are large and dealing with them is slow.
      2 means regular build with symbols.
      1 means minimal symbols, usually enough for backtraces only. Symbols with
    internal linkage (static functions or those in anonymous namespaces) may not
    appear when using this level.
      0 means no symbols.
      -1 means auto-set according to debug/release and platform.

sysroot
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/sysroot.gni:20

    The path of the sysroot for the current toolchain. If empty, default
    sysroot is used.

system_libdir
    Current value (from the default) = "lib"
      From //build/config/linux/pkg_config.gni:47

    CrOS systemroots place pkgconfig files at <systemroot>/usr/share/pkgconfig
    and one of <systemroot>/usr/lib/pkgconfig or <systemroot>/usr/lib64/pkgconfig
    depending on whether the systemroot is for a 32 or 64 bit architecture.
   
    When build under GYP, CrOS board builds specify the 'system_libdir' variable
    as part of the GYP_DEFINES provided by the CrOS emerge build or simple
    chrome build scheme. This variable permits controlling this for GN builds
    in similar fashion by setting the `system_libdir` variable in the build's
    args.gn file to 'lib' or 'lib64' as appropriate for the target architecture.

target_cpu
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      (Internally set; try `gn help target_cpu`.)

target_os
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      (Internally set; try `gn help target_os`.)

target_rpath
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/chromecast_build.gni:27

    If non empty, rpath of executables is set to this.
    If empty, default value is used.

target_sysroot
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/sysroot.gni:13

    The path of the sysroot that is applied when compiling using the target
    toolchain.

target_sysroot_dir
    Current value (from the default) = "//build/linux"
      From //build/config/sysroot.gni:16

    The path to directory containing linux sysroot images.

target_winuwp_family
    Current value = "desktop"
      From //out/Release/args.gn:14
    Overridden from the default = "app"
      From //build/config/win/BUILD.gn:33

    possible values:
      "app" - Windows Store Applications
      "phone" - Windows Phone Applications
      "system" - Windows Drivers and Tools
      "server" - Windows Server Applications
      "desktop" - Windows Desktop Applications

target_winuwp_version
    Current value (from the default) = "10"
      From //build/config/win/BUILD.gn:25

    possible values for target_winuwp_version:
      "10" - Windows UWP 10
      "8.1" - Windows RT 8.1
      "8.0" - Windows RT 8.0

thin_lto_enable_optimizations
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:122

tint_build_hlsl_writer

      From //third_party/tint/tint_overrides_with_defaults.gni:62

toolkit_views
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/ui.gni:41

    True means the UI is built using the "views" framework.

treat_warnings_as_errors
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:32

    Default to warnings as errors for default workflow, where we catch
    warnings with known toolchains. Allow overriding this e.g. for Chromium
    builds on Linux that could use a different version of the compiler.
    With GCC, warnings in no-Chromium code are always not treated as errors.

use_afl
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:86

    Compile for fuzzing with AFL.

use_aura
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/ui.gni:36

    Indicates if Aura is enabled. Aura is a low-level windowing library, sort
    of a replacement for GDI or GTK.

use_cfi_cast
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:126

    Enable checks for bad casts: derived cast and unrelated cast.
    TODO(krasin): remove this, when we're ready to add these checks by default.
    https://crbug.com/626794

use_cfi_diag
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:75

    Print detailed diagnostics when Control Flow Integrity detects a violation.

use_cfi_icall
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:71

    Enable checks for indirect function calls via a function pointer.
    TODO(pcc): remove this when we're ready to add these checks by default.
    https://crbug.com/701919
   
    TODO(crbug.com/1159424): Reassess the validity of the next expression.

use_cfi_recover
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:79

    Let Control Flow Integrity continue execution instead of crashing when
    printing diagnostics (use_cfi_diag = true).

use_clang_coverage
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/coverage/coverage.gni:17

    Enable Clang's Source-based Code Coverage.

use_clang_diagnostics_format
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/win/BUILD.gn:42

    Set this to use clang-style diagnostics format instead of MSVC-style, which
    is useful in e.g. Emacs compilation mode.
    E.g.:
     Without this, clang emits a diagnostic message like this:
       foo/bar.cc(12,34): error: something went wrong
     and with this switch, clang emits it like this:
       foo/bar.cc:12:34: error: something went wrong

use_clang_profiling
    Current value (from the default) = false

use_clang_profiling_inside_sandbox
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:177

use_custom_libcxx
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/c++/c++.gni:14

    Use in-tree libc++ (buildtools/third_party/libc++ and
    buildtools/third_party/libc++abi) instead of the system C++ library for C++
    standard library support.
    Don't check in changes that set this to false for more platforms; doing so
    is not supported.

use_custom_libcxx_for_host
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/c++/c++.gni:26

    Use libc++ instead of stdlibc++ when using the host_cpu toolchain, even if
    use_custom_libcxx is false. This is useful for cross-compiles where a custom
    toolchain for the target_cpu has been set as the default toolchain, but
    use_custom_libcxx should still be true when building for the host.  The
    expected usage is to set use_custom_libcxx=false and
    use_custom_libcxx_for_host=true in the passed in buildargs.

use_cxx11
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:82

    Allow projects that wish to stay on C++11 to override Chromium's default.

use_cxx11_on_android
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:166

    C++11 may not be an option if Android test infrastructure is used.

use_dbus
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/features.gni:31

use_debug_fission
    Current value (from the default) = "default"
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:63

    use_debug_fission: whether to use split DWARF debug info
    files. This can reduce link time significantly, but is incompatible
    with some utilities such as icecc and ccache. Requires gold and
    gcc >= 4.8 or clang.
    http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DebugFission
   
    This is a placeholder value indicating that the code below should set
    the default.  This is necessary to delay the evaluation of the default
    value expression until after its input values such as use_gold have
    been set, e.g. by a toolchain_args() block.

use_dummy_lastchange
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/util/lastchange.gni:9

use_dwarf5
    Current value (from the default) = false

use_ghash
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:112

    Turn this on to use ghash feature of lld for faster debug link on Windows.

use_gio
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/features.gni:33

use_glib
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/ui.gni:44

    Whether we should use glib, a low level C utility library.

use_gold
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:204

    Whether to use the gold linker from binutils instead of lld or bfd.

use_goma
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/goma.gni:9

    Set to true to enable distributed compilation using Goma.

use_goma_thin_lto
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:76

    If true, use Goma for ThinLTO code generation where applicable.

    Enables JaCoCo Java code coverage.

use_java_goma
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/goma.gni:26

    TODO(crbug.com/726475): true if use_goma = true in the future.

use_libfuzzer
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:83

    Compile for fuzzing with LLVM LibFuzzer.
    See http://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/libfuzzer

use_libpci
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //third_party/angle/BUILD.gn:23

use_lld
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:199

    Set to true to use lld, the LLVM linker.
    Not supported for macOS (see docs/mac_lld.md), and not functional at all for
    iOS. The default linker everywhere else.

use_locally_built_instrumented_libraries
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:50

    Use dynamic libraries instrumented by one of the sanitizers instead of the
    standard system libraries. Set this flag to build the libraries from source.

use_ozone
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/ui.gni:27

use_rtti
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:73

    Build with C++ RTTI enabled. Chromium builds without RTTI by default,
    but some sanitizers are known to require it, like CFI diagnostics
    and UBsan variants.

use_sanitizer_configs_without_instrumentation
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:116

    When enabled, only relevant sanitizer defines are set, but compilation
    happens with no extra flags. This is useful when in component build
    enabling sanitizers only in some of the components.

use_sanitizer_coverage
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/sanitizers/sanitizers.gni:168

use_swiftshader_with_subzero
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //third_party/swiftshader/src/Reactor/BUILD.gn:21

use_sysroot
    Current value (from the default) = true
      From //build/config/sysroot.gni:24

    Controls default is_linux sysroot. If set to true, and sysroot
    is empty, default sysroot is calculated.

use_system_xcode
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build_overrides/build.gni:21

    In standalone Dawn builds, don't try to use the hermetic install of Xcode
    that Chromium uses

use_text_section_splitting
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/BUILD.gn:144

    This argument is to control whether enabling text section splitting in the
    final binary. When enabled, the separated text sections with prefix
    '.text.hot', '.text.unlikely', '.text.startup' and '.text.exit' will not be
    merged to '.text' section. This allows us to identify the hot code section
    ('.text.hot') in the binary which may be mlocked or mapped to huge page to
    reduce TLB misses which gives performance improvement on cpu usage.
    The gold linker by default has text section splitting enabled.

use_thin_lto
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:70

    Enables support for ThinLTO, which links 3x-10x faster than full LTO. See
    also http://blog.llvm.org/2016/06/thinlto-scalable-and-incremental-lto.html
    Use it by default on official-optimized android and Chrome OS builds, but
    not ARC or linux-chromeos since it's been seen to not play nicely with
    Chrome's clang. crbug.com/1033839

use_udev
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/features.gni:29

    libudev usage. This currently only affects the content layer.

use_x11
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/ui.gni:32

    Indicates if the UI toolkit depends on X11.
    Enabled by default. Can be disabled if Ozone only build is required and
    vice-versa.

use_xcode_clang
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/toolchain/toolchain.gni:23

    Compile with Xcode version of clang instead of hermetic version shipped
    with the build. Used to be used iOS for official builds, but is now off by
    default for all configurations.

using_mismatched_sample_profile
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/compiler/compiler.gni:83

    Whether we're using a sample profile collected on an architecture different
    than the one we're compiling for.
   
    It's currently not possible to collect AFDO profiles on anything but
    x86{,_64}.

v8_current_cpu
    Current value (from the default) = "x64"
      From //build/config/v8_target_cpu.gni:60

    This argument is declared here so that it can be overridden in toolchains.
    It should never be explicitly set by the user.

v8_target_cpu
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/v8_target_cpu.gni:33

    This arg is used when we want to tell the JIT-generating v8 code
    that we want to have it generate for an architecture that is different
    than the architecture that v8 will actually run on; we then run the
    code under an emulator. For example, we might run v8 on x86, but
    generate arm code and run that under emulation.
   
    This arg is defined here rather than in the v8 project because we want
    some of the common architecture-specific args (like arm_float_abi or
    mips_arch_variant) to be set to their defaults either if the current_cpu
    applies *or* if the v8_current_cpu applies.
   
    As described below, you can also specify the v8_target_cpu to use
    indirectly by specifying a `custom_toolchain` that contains v8_$cpu in the
    name after the normal toolchain.
   
    For example, `gn gen --args="custom_toolchain=...:clang_x64_v8_arm64"`
    is equivalent to setting --args=`v8_target_cpu="arm64"`. Setting
    `custom_toolchain` is more verbose but makes the toolchain that is
    (effectively) being used explicit.
   
    v8_target_cpu can only be used to target one architecture in a build,
    so if you wish to build multiple copies of v8 that are targeting
    different architectures, you will need to do something more
    complicated involving multiple toolchains along the lines of
    custom_toolchain, above.

visual_studio_path
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/win/visual_studio_version.gni:9

    Path to Visual Studio. If empty, the default is used which is to use the
    automatic toolchain in depot_tools. If set, you must also set the
    visual_studio_version and wdk_path.

visual_studio_version
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/win/visual_studio_version.gni:13

    Version of Visual Studio pointed to by the visual_studio_path.
    Currently always "2015".

wdk_path
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/win/visual_studio_version.gni:17

    Directory of the Windows driver kit. If visual_studio_path is empty, this
    will be auto-filled.

win_enable_cfg_guards
    Current value (from the default) = false
      From //build/config/win/control_flow_guard.gni:10

    Set this to true to enable generation of CFG indirect call dispatch
    guards.

win_linker_timing
    Current value = true
      From //out/Release/args.gn:15
    Overridden from the default = false
      From //build/config/win/BUILD.gn:19

    Turn this on to have the linker output extra timing information.

windows_sdk_path
    Current value (from the default) = "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10"
      From //build/config/win/visual_studio_version.gni:22

    Full path to the Windows SDK, not including a backslash at the end.
    This value is the default location, override if you have a different
    installation location.

x64_arch
    Current value (from the default) = ""
      From //build/config/x64.gni:16

    The micro architecture of x64 cpu. This will be a string like "haswell" or
    "skylake". An empty string means to use the default architecture which is
    "x86-64".
